# Reciplease

A new kind of recipe book. In a world of online databases we created a user friendly personal cookbook. The user can upload family recipies or their personal favorites and share them with friends, family, and our Reciplease community. The next time you are at a bbq and taste someone's homemade mac n cheese asking, "Recipe, please!" is now as easy as a click of a button.

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository [HERE](git@github.com:Pcon27/Reciplease.git)

### Prerequisites

Install the node_modules and package.json by running an npm i from your terminal. Be sure to include express, sequelize, mysql2, bcrypt, and dotenv packages.

Be sure to populate the .env file with your mysql password.

```
DB_NAME=recipe_db
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=SECRETPASSWORD
```

A great tool to see our database and check routes is Insonmia [HERE](https://insomnia.rest/download)

### Installing

From your terminal login to mysql inside the db file.

```
Reciplease % cd db

db % mysql -u root -p

Enter password:

Welcome to the MySQL monitor.
```

Then source the database and exit:

```
mysql> source schema.sql;
Query OK, 4 rows affected (0.06 sec)

Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> exit
```

Exit mysql and leave the db folder. Then run a npm seed command to seed our database.

```
db % cd ..
Reciplease % npm run seed
```

Now you can run an npm start to start your local server and see our database in action.

```
Reciplease % npm run start
```

From Insomnia you can run the routes and see what recipes our users have created.
